Dev version of the application can be reviewed for evaluation.

### JavaScript (ES5)

JavaScript is written in common cross-browser version without the need for ranspiler like for ES6. It also is written on purpose without usage of libraries such as jQuery to traverse the DOM to demonstrate capacity to traverse the DOM with pure JavaScript.

The only libraries are used, are animation libraries to demostrate what's possible. And even that can be removed, for the owner of the code is capable to animate without libraries.
